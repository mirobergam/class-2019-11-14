### Graphical Relationship between dvote and dem_adv

```{r}


#Dem_Adv and Dvote

ggplot(data, aes(dem_adv, dvote)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Logistical model of dvote and dem_adv

### Graphical relationship between dvote and female

```{r}

glm_obj <- glm(data = data, dvote ~ female, family = 'binomial')

ggplot(data, aes(female, dvote)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomal", se = FALSE))

summary(glm_obj) %>% coef()
```


### Two logistical models: regular and Bayesian
